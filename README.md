## Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a devastating loss of human life worldwide and presents an unprecedented challenge to public health, food systems and the world of work. In the context of global pandemic, analyzing infectious disease characteristics and trends, evaluating its impact have become pressing needs for pandemic recovery and prevention. As a result, we choose to analyze data of Influenza in this project. Our goal is to find the temporal trend, spatial trend, and impact of influenza on people's online behabior. The conclusion of the project would be used to help the prevention and revory from the epidemic.

## Statistical Questions of Interest
In order to reach the conclusion mentioned in the introduction, we separated the research question into three sub-questions. The first question of interest is to analyze the regional and temporal distribution the Influenza case number and illiness rate, and find the possible factor that can make influence on the distribution. In this section, we mainly visualized the data by region using matplotlib to make the guess, and adopt correlation function to jutisfy it. The second question is how average influenza hospitalization rates distribute in different age group. In the analysis of this question, we calculated the hospitality rate of each group, visualized it, and found Influenza is more infections in which age group. The last one is how does Influenza impact people's online activities. In this section, we drawed the plot of the number of illiness case and flu-related website hit number of Google to see their trend and correlation. The detail of the project would be included in the following sections.
