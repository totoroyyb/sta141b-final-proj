# Fetch Data Using Customized Middleware

## Overview

We built this middleware to help us fetch the API request and meanwhile store the data into a local database in the consideration of future access. This middleware can automatically handle the case of duplicated entries and also provide a convenient interface for constructing the parameters for the API request.

For basic usage to start up, you can refer to the **[Basic Usage](#basic-usage)** section.

For more details about the structure of this middleware, you can refer to the **[Architecture](#architecture)** section.
